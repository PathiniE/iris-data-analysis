# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification with Logistic Regression

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and classification model based on the **Iris dataset**, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and statistics. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify an iris flower into one of three species â€” **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** â€” using features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Is About

- ðŸ§ª Performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Iris dataset.
- ðŸ“ˆ Visualizing patterns and correlations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
- ðŸ¤– Building a **logistic regression model** using **scikit-learn** to predict flower species.
- ðŸ§  Creating a reusable function `predict_species()` to classify new input measurements.
- ðŸ’¡ Designed for beginners learning data science, machine learning, and Jupyter Notebooks.
